The Sequential model makes the assumption that the network has exactly one input and exactly one output, and that it consists of a linear stack of layers. However, this set of assumptions is too inflexible in a number of cases. Some networks require several independent inputs, some others require multiple outputs, and some networks have internal branching between layers making them look like graphs of layers rather than linear stacks of layers. \n",
    "These three important use cases—multi-input models, multi-output models, and graph-like models—are not possible when using only the Sequential model class in Keras. But there is also a different, far more general and flexible way to use Keras: the functional API. This sections explains in detail what it is, what it can do, and how to use it."
