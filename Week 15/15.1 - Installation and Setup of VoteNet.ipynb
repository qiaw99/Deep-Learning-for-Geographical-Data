    "# 15.1 - Installation and Setup of VoteNet\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise on the application of VoteNet for building detection in 3D airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds is organized in several notebooks. In this first notebook, the installation and setup of the network source code as well as the exercise files and notebooks are explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the second notebook concentrates on the ISPRS dataset with the corresponding files and classes that provides the data to the network for training and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, the necessary modifications on the VoteNet neural network model to the specifics of the data basis of ALS data are explained. The implementation of VoteNet is based on 3D point clouds of indoor environments, so the changes for ALS data are mainly due to the larger size of the real objects and the comparably lower point density.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer: This exercise and notebook are based on prototypically prepared data and conducted experiments. There are therefore many aspects that could be improved, and it cannot be ruled out that there are logical and programming errors.**"
